In this question you will implement a member function adapter for a member
function that takes a single argument (STL allows only void member functions.)
Refer to the example implementation of member function adapter with no
arguments, see class web-site.

You'll have to implement 1 class. 

Your code should be in a single file memfun.adapter.h,
